## **Evaluation Framework**

The literature-based evaluation framework developed will be used to assess effectiveness of visualizations related to climate change illustrated below.

The framework consists of three key categories and it will be rated from 1 to 3, 3 meaning the criteria has been fully met.

1. **Data integrity:** The data is represented is consistent, accurate, and trustworthy. Factors to consider includes appropriate scales used, baseline and interval of axis, relative or absolute data used, unambiguous keys or legends utilized, appropriate aspect ratio, and presence of thin data. [1],[2]

2. **Coherence:** The purpose of the visualization is illustrated in a coherent manner. Some factors to consider includes if there is an information overload, or missing information on the charts, if the data presented is relevant to the story, if appropriate charts are used. [1]

3. **Audience:** The overall visualization is easy to comprehend. To consider the effectiveness, factors such as, font size, colors utilized (e.g. color-blind friendly), interpretive title, data-ink ratio, dimensions, acronym used, time taken to understand the chart(relative). [1]

#### Chart 1

The chart title simply states, “Mapping global temperature changes: every year from 1850 to 2017” without further information if there has been an increase or decrease, but the color utilized makes it easy to understand that in the recent years the temperature has increased. The x axis is not labelled yet one can still somewhat interpret that the next point refers to the next year. However, it is not easy to see each year and the temperature for a specific region as the image is too small, thus, it would have been better to use a different form of visualization.
