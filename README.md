# Self Study Project on Climate Change Visualisations
 The project consist of two parts. 
 
The first part includes collecting 5 distinctly different visualizations of climate change and assessing it by developing a literature-based evaluation framework. 

The second part includes replicating this [visualization](http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/2018/warming-stripes/) of climate change to the best of my abilities.
