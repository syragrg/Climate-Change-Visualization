##### Climate Change Self Study- Development of framework and assessment of charts related to climate change

# **Evaluation Framework**

The literature-based evaluation framework developed will be used to assess effectiveness of visualizations related to climate change illustrated below.

The framework consists of three key categories and it will be rated from 1 to 3, 3 meaning the criteria has been fully met.

1. **Data integrity:** The data is represented is consistent, accurate, and trustworthy. Factors to consider includes appropriate scales used, baseline and interval of axis, relative or absolute data used, unambiguous keys or legends utilized, appropriate aspect ratio, and presence of thin data. [1],[2]

2. **Coherence:** The purpose of the visualization is illustrated in a coherent manner. Some factors to consider includes if there is an information overload, or missing information on the charts, if the data presented is relevant to the story, if appropriate charts are used. [1]

3. **Audience:** The overall visualization is easy to comprehend. To consider the effectiveness, factors such as, font size, colors utilized (e.g. color-blind friendly), interpretive title, data-ink ratio, dimensions, acronym used, time taken to understand the chart(relative). [1]

# **Assessment**
### Chart 1: 
Mapping global temperature change

![](https://github.com/syragrg/ClimateChange-SelfStudyProject/blob/master/ChartsAssessed/chart1.png?raw=true)
[3]

The chart title simply states, “Mapping global temperature changes: every year from 1850 to 2017” without further information if there has been an increase or decrease, but the color utilized makes it easy to understand that in the recent years the temperature has increased. The x axis is not labelled yet one can still somewhat interpret that the next point refers to the next year. However, it is not easy to see each year and the temperature for a specific region as the image is too small, thus, it would have been better to use a different form of visualization.

Data Integrity | Coherence| Audience
------------ | ------------- | -------------
 3 | 1 | 2
 
### Chart 2:
Increases and decreases in global temperature during the naturally occurring ice ages of the past 800,000 years, ending with the early twentieth century

[4]
 
The title of the graph says global temperature over the years, however, the y-axis title refers to the points as difference from the average. The title does not match what the graph shows. The chart is difficult to interpret, and the audience has to take time to understand what the average is and what the graph is trying to illustrate. Based on the fluctuation, it seems that not a significant change in temperature has occurred now when compared to 800,000 years ago, hence it can be deduced from the chart that climate change is natural occurrence and not caused from human activity. More information explaining the visualization is needed.

### Chart 3:
Influence of greenhouse gases on actual temperature increase

![](https://github.com/syragrg/ClimateChange-SelfStudyProject/blob/master/ChartsAssessed/chart3.png?raw=true)
[5]

The visualization illustrates the increase in temperature from the average for the year 1880 till 2005. It is evident that the temperature has been inclining. The lines are easy to see and are distinct from one another. While the green line shows the influence of greenhouse gas emissions, the explanation is ambiguous, and more information can be provided in the visualization. 

Data Integrity | Coherence| Audience
------------ | ------------- | -------------
 3 | 2 | 3

### Chart 4:
Global temperature changes since pre-industrial times

![](https://github.com/syragrg/ClimateChange-SelfStudyProject/blob/master/ChartsAssessed/chart%204.png?raw=true)
[6]

The graph illustrates the changes in global temperature by month. The graph looks like tangled spaghetti and it is difficult to follow a single line. While the graph is informative, it is not easy to read and looks messy, which could be off-putting for the audience. It would also be better to have a more visible line at point 0. 

Data Integrity | Coherence| Audience
------------ | ------------- | -------------
 3 | 2 | 1

### Chart 5:
CO2 levels during the last three glacial cycles, as reconstructed from ice cores

![](https://github.com/syragrg/ClimateChange-SelfStudyProject/blob/master/ChartsAssessed/chart5.png?raw=true)
[7]

Data is presently clearly and the visualization itself is very clean and easy to read. It is very coherent and clearly tells the audience that CO2 level is higher than ever recorded. It would be good to show what the average level of CO2 level is to provide more insight on the CO2 level over the years. 

Data Integrity | Coherence| Audience
------------ | ------------- | -------------
 3 |2  | 3

## Conclusion

Out of the 5 graphs, the 3rd and the 5th graph makes use of visualization in the most effective manner. Both of them are simple, making it easy to internalize. At the same time, the illustrations are also concise and informative, fulfilling the purpose of the graphs very clearly.
